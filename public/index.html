      <h2>A History of Suite</h2>
      <p>Suite is located in the basement of Dunningham House. Prior to the large scale waterfront and Viaduct land reclamation, this building was near waterfront property. Built in 1920, Dunningham House was known for most of its life as the “Spice House”. The basement, which is now the home of Suite, was used to store bulk imports of spices into New Zealand. From here, the spices were broken down into smaller, more manageable parcels, and distributed around the country. It was not until the late eighties that the space was converted into a licensed food and alcohol venue.</p>
      <p>The basement site was first opened as Soho, a fine dining restaurant, which specialised in the corporate lunch trade, and after work drinking. At this time, the bar was located underneath the windows on the Wolfe Street wall. Soho was an Auckland institution but was sadly sold after many years of successful trade.</p>
      <p>Auckland hospitality doyen Kevin Frazer (Lime, Plum, and Boogie Wonderland) purchased Soho, changing the space into the now legendary Hobson Street Lounge. With Sumo, Stafford and Ash behind the stick, and an open 360 degree horseshoe bar, Hobson Street Lounge led the new era of cocktail culture in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>From there the space evolved into Pickle, one of our city’s original tapas bars. Kevin and his father rebuilt the space, forming the partitioned bar that still exists today. Pickle had two subsequent owners in 2004-2005, before the present team came on board.</p>
      <p>In January 2006, Pickle was no more, and Suite was born. With a desire to showcase the best quality New Zealand products, art, and music, whilst bringing international standards of bartending to New Zealand shores, this vibrant community found itself a new lounge. Suite’s ethos of quality and innovation realise themselves in a relaxed and fun environment. We seek to provide new experiences, and support the best that the community has to offer.</p>
      <p>Almost six years on, Suite is one of New Zealand’s most awarded bars and is very proud of the hard work of its current and former employees who have raised the bar in New Zealand hospitality both here and abroad.</p>

      <h2>Science | Experimental | Molecular</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Suite Bar’s laboratory. We create, play, conjure and develop drinks that are sometimes a bit crazy, but we like it that way. All our homemade concoctions, molecular creations or our competition cocktails live here and this section changes frequent- ly. If you’re not so sure about the sounds of some of these drinks, ask us about the process behind creating them... We might just be able to change your mind.</p>

        <h3>Horse & Cart</h3>
        <p>Bas Armagnac Fine, Cruzan Black Strap, Galliano Authentico, Maple Syrup, TBT Old Time Aromatic Bitters, Crunchy Nut Cornflake Infused Milk</p>
        <p>I really wanted to put a milk punch on the menu after being in the US and literally drinking it everyday! I also wanted to make good use of the current cereal infusion trend but keep it kind of classic, so i used Arma- gnac instead of Cognac, Rum, sugar and infused milk. Hope you like it.

        <h3>Ginger Apple Fizz</h3>
        <P>Appleton’s 8, Stones Ginger Wine, Fresh Lime Juice, Egg White, Homemade Lime Sorbet, Re-Carbonated Apple Cider</P>
        <p>I got the idea for this drink when I was playing around with sorbet and discovered how it changes the profile of the drink as it melts. So I decided to make my own sorbet and build my flavours around the lime incorporating other fruits. Kenny Ariaens</p>

        <h3>Oaxacan Julep</h3>
        <p>Arette Blanco, Del Maguey Chichicapa, Agave Syrup, Bittermens Boston Bittahs, TBT Celery Bitters, Fresh Basil</p>
        <p>For this drink I wanted to use the similar vegetal flavours that exist in Mezcal and Basil. I used a julep style of cocktail which controls dilution well and keeps the drink cold which is essential. Enjoy. Margarita Vovna 25</p>

      <div class='cocktail'>
        <h3>I Got Beetroot On Mai Tai</h3>
        <p>Appleton’s 8, Homemade Beetroot Syrup, Fresh Lime Juice, Orgeat Syrup, TBT Pimento Dram, Peychaud’s Bitters</p>
        <p>I got my idea for this drink during an Appleton tasting with Allen the representative for Appleton’s/The Rum Company. We did food matches with the rum and I wanted to use beetroot because of its earthy/sweet characteristics which provide a clear match with the 8yr Appleton’s. Barney Toy</p>

  %h2 A History of Suite
  %p Suite is located in the basement of Dunningham House. Prior to the large scale waterfront and Viaduct land reclamation, this building was near waterfront property. Built in 1920, Dunningham House was known for most of its life as the “Spice House”. The basement, which is now the home of Suite, was used to store bulk imports of spices into New Zealand. From here, the spices were broken down into smaller, more manageable parcels, and distributed around the country. It was not until the late eighties that the space was converted into a licensed food and alcohol venue.
  %p The basement site was first opened as Soho, a fine dining restaurant, which specialised in the corporate lunch trade, and after work drinking. At this time, the bar was located underneath the windows on the Wolfe Street wall. Soho was an Auckland institution but was sadly sold after many years of successful trade.
  %p Auckland hospitality doyen Kevin Frazer (Lime, Plum, and Boogie Wonderland) purchased Soho, changing the space into the now legendary Hobson Street Lounge. With Sumo, Stafford and Ash behind the stick, and an open 360 degree horseshoe bar, Hobson Street Lounge led the new era of cocktail culture in New Zealand.
  %p From there the space evolved into Pickle, one of our city’s original tapas bars. Kevin and his father rebuilt the space, forming the partitioned bar that still exists today. Pickle had two subsequent owners in 2004-2005, before the present team came on board.
  %p In January 2006, Pickle was no more, and Suite was born. With a desire to showcase the best quality New Zealand products, art, and music, whilst bringing international standards of bartending to New Zealand shores, this vibrant community found itself a new lounge. Suite’s ethos of quality and innovation realise themselves in a relaxed and fun environment. We seek to provide new experiences, and support the best that the community has to offer.
  %p Almost six years on, Suite is one of New Zealand’s most awarded bars and is very proud of the hard work of its current and former employees who have raised the bar in New Zealand hospitality both here and abroad.
